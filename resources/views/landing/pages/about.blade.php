                    Our Marigold Flower Business aims to develop the potential of marigold (Calendula) flowers, which have long been recognized in agriculture and traditional medicine. In Indonesia, these flowers serve not only as ornamental plants but are also frequently used in various traditional ceremonies. We believe that the potential of marigold as a commercial product is still vast and ripe for further development.

                    With a vision to revitalize public interest in marigold flowers, we plan to create a marigold garden that functions as a cultivation site, educational center, and tourist destination. Currently, we are developing several varieties of marigold flowers and collaborating with Gunadarma University to create marigold-based products, such as essential oils, ointments, and herbal teas, through academic research and innovation.

                    While we acknowledge the challenges in this journey, such as the limited development of marigold flower varieties, we believe that with community support and the right approach, our business will overcome these obstacles. We also see great opportunities to attract tourists and local communities who are increasingly drawn to natural and organic products.
